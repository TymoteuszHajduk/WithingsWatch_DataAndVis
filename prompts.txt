CHART 1:
result_list.append((date, start,end, total_sleep_time, lightsleepduration, remsleepduration, deepsleepduration, sleep_score, waso))
you are given a pandas dataframe with those columns. you have to pivot it into long. make a floating bar chart using altair.
end corresponds to wakeup, i want it to be on top, start to faliing asleep. i want segments based on shares.shares are self explanatory - deep, rem and light.
end and start are unix timestamps, so you have to modulo by 86400 and divide by 3600 to get something that makes sense. keep the colors bleak and scientific.
bonus points if tooltip displays date ('date' is stored as unix too)
prompt 2 (improvement):
okay. modifications - you are gonna need a custom x axis, with values looping(1 comes after 24).
here is a snippet of the database: 34440,16740,4860,12840. largest value is duration, you can use that to determine if WASO is needed


CHART 2:
write altair code for an area chart. x axis is hours stored as numbers of seconds from midnight..

it represents intensity of a phenomenon over the day. i want it really classy.
make it a function that accepts a dataframe, columns are 'timestamp' and 'value'. i want the tooltip to only display the value as'Steps: {value}'

CHART 3:
write logic for an altair chart that takes a dataframe with two columns: one is 'date' stored as a unix timestamp corresponding to 0:0 hour
, the second is a bool value 'status'.
i need a calendar - sort of layout that will display white boxes for falses and red boxes for trues, but its only 7 days, starting monday.
dark bleak scientific blues, classy look
a thin frame. labels '{day of the week}/next day of the week}' labels, as the data represents nights

CHART 4:
Write logic for an altair line chart that takes a dataframe with two columns: 'date' stored as unix timestamp, 'mean' as the value.
3 boxes, deep green associated with vitality for values sub 55, lighter green 55-80, rotten brownish yellow above. limit y axis 40-120
